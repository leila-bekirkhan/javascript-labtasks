# Task: Age Comparison

Building on the previous age calculation task, we'll now add some comparisons.

Using the `ageJoanne` and `ageSarah` variables from **Task4**, perform the following comparisons:

1. Check if Joanne is older than Sarah.
2. Check if Sarah is 18 years old or younger.
3. Print the results of both comparisons to the console using `console.log()`.
