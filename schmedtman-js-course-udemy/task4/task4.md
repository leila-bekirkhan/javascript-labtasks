1. Current year: 2037
2. Joanne's birth year: 1966
3. Sarah's birth year: 2017

## Assignment:

1. Create a variable `nowYear` and assign it the value of the current year (2037).
2. Calculate Joanne's age and store the result in a variable called `ageJoanne`.
3. Calculate Sarah's age and store the result in a variable called `ageSarah`.
4. Print the values of `ageJoanne` and `ageSarah` to the console.

## Notes:

* Use arithmetic operations to calculate the ages.
* Use `console.log()` to print to the console.

## Expected Output:

If solved correctly, two numbers should be displayed in the console: Joanne's age and Sarah's age.
