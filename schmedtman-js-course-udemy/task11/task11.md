# JavaScript Average Age Calculation Task

In this task, you'll build upon a previous age calculation exercise to compute the average age of two people. This will reinforce your understanding of variables, arithmetic operations, and introduce the concept of averaging values.

## Prerequisites:

You should have completed the previous task (**[Task 8](https://github.com/leila-bekirkhan/javascript-labtasks/blob/28daf6d2cb5e442350aad2fb44ba29a89cadb5a1/schmedtman-js-course-udemy/task8/task8.js)**) where you calculated the ages of Joanne and Sarah.

## Objectives:

1. Use previously calculated values in a new computation
2. Calculate the average of two numbers
3. Understand the order of operations in arithmetic expressions

## Task Steps:

1. Average Age Calculation:
   * Create a new constant variable named `averageAge`.
   * Calculate the average age by adding `ageJoanne` and `ageSarah`, then dividing the sum by 2.
   * Assign this result to `averageAge`.
2. Output:
   * Use `console.log()` to print the values of `ageJoanne`, `ageSarah`, and `averageAge`.
