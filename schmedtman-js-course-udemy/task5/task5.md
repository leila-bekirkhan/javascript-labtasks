# Task: Age Calculation

Using the solution from **Task4**, perform the following:

1. Calculate double Joanne's age.
2. Calculate one-fifth of Sarah's age.
3. Print the results of these calculations to the console using a single `console.log()` statement.

## Important Notes:

* Use arithmetic operations to calculate the ages.
* Perform the mathematical operations directly within the `console.log()` statement.
* You can use the `ageJoanne` and `ageSarah` variables.

## Expected Output for Task 2:

When solved correctly, two numbers should be displayed in the console: double Joanne's age and one-fifth of Sarah's age, calculated directly in the console.log() statement.
