# Task: Name Concatenation

You're working on a program that needs to combine a person's first name and last name into a full name.

## Assignment:

1. Create a constant variable `firstName` and assign it the value "Joanne".
2. Create a constant variable `lastName` and assign it the value "Rowling".
3. Use `console.log()` to print the full name by concatenating `firstName`, `space`, and `lastName`.

## Notes:

* The output should show the full name with a space between the first name and last name. Use string literals with a space.
