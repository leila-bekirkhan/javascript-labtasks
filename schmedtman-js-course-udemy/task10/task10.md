# JavaScript Chained Assignment Task

In this task, you'll explore variable declaration and chained assignment in JavaScript. You'll see how multiple variables can be assigned the same value in a single line of code.

## Objectives:

1. Declare multiple variables at once
2. Understand and use chained assignment
3. Perform arithmetic operations within an assignment

## Task Steps:

1. Variable Declaration:

   * Declare two variables, `x` and `y`, without initializing them.
2. Chained Assignment and Arithmetic:

   * In a single line, perform the following operations:
     a. Calculate the result of 245 - 45 + 80
     b. Assign this result to `y`
     c. Assign the value of `y` to `x`
3. Output:

   * Use `console.log()` to print the values of both `x` and `y`.
